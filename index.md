## Rocky Hankin's Code Website

This is where I'll upload things I've worked on for the sake of job applications. Most of these are programming assignements for CS classes I've taken in college.
In these cases I haven't written 100% of the code, but I've left the comments on the starter code intact which typically make clear which parts I worked on/was allowed to work on. 
<p>I'm making this for my Blizzard internship application in my Junior year and I'm trying to put everything I've done that I have access to, so apologies that things are unfinished atm. I aim to have this all done within a few days. If the site is super duper broken atm then I
suggest waiting a few days.</p>
