//Found this while combing through here to upload stuff to my website. Not sure what it's about. Astra is the name of my dog though. I was probably having difficulty running something and made a basic program to see if I could run literally anything at all.

public class Astra {
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Asta");
    }
}
