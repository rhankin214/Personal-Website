## CSE 8B PA4: The Maze

The purpose of this PA was to read and understand an existing MazePoint class and use it write methods that work with it. Includes creating mazes from input files, printing, a comparison method, and solving the maze.

CSE 8B focused hard on teaching us clean coding and test driven development. The formatting guidelines were very strict. There was also a mountain of test-making. Gotta teach us early, I guess.
