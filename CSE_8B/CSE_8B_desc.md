## CSE 8B

The first CSE course I took at UCSD. It focused hard on clean coding and test driven development. I learned to write extremely thorough tests. I also had to write very thorough comments detailing all of my methods. The coding itself was mostly java stuff I already knew.

The PAs for this class had extensive starter code that we would build files to work with. For example, we'd write the backing code for a 2048 game and starter code would handle all the GUI elements.
