Been meaning to actually make a videogame for so damn long. I watched a fantasy series that was meant to be a sort of dark fantasy riff on the usual magic school setup, but it ended up disappointing me. It got me to feel inspired so I ended up starting whatever this is.

Making my own game is something that I've tried to do for the longest time, but I never managed to focus myself. I've made a lot . I'm hoping the 21 year old version of me can manage what the younger versions couldn't.

The main hurdle for me right now is learning how to do the 3d graphics. I want a similar style to the older trails game, maybe a bit simplified compared to that. Been working on learning javafx. I know it makes way more sense to just use unity or unreal, but for the sake of getting myself to actually work on this I wanted something I could just open up in vscode and work on. May swap over eventually.

At the very least I want to get basic combat functionality working before I hop onto any of that.
